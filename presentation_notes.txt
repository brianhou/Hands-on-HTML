HANDS-ON HTML

Draw a picture of what you would like to be turned into HTML and our service renders and displays the webpage, preserving positioning! Denote images which you would like embedded by enclosing them in a thick black box. Text is automatically detected and rendered in a pretty font!

Then, use hand gesture recognition to dynamically reposition, scale, and rotate the different components of the webpage you created, to calibrate the layout.
